<h1> Welcome to my Bio </h1>

<p> Hello my name is Harry Mosdell this page will contain
  my Bio and casual information about  myself. I spend my
  leisure time socialising with friends, watching films and
  using social media. I am a passionate fan of Arsenal
  Football Club and I also enjoy watching Formula One. before
  i studied at the University of Northampton i used to study at
  the University of Portsmouth studying computer engineering.
 </p>

 <p>  engineering interested me as I find them
   fascinating subjects to study. Without the technology we have,
   access to the world would not be the same as we know it.
    I also find it interesting that without engineers we couldnt
    create and look after the technology that is available to us.
Im also interested in this course as when its completed I will
 have the relevant qualifications needed to get a job in a
 technology based career. A reason why I want to do so is that
 the technology and engineering industry is always developing and
 changing so there would always be jobs available.
     </P>

<p>
My Engineering course in Portsmouth was based on five modules and
has essentially taught myself the basics of engineering. My modules were
engineering mathematics, engineering principles (physics), electrical
 engineering (physics),  engineering materials and design (chemistry
 and architecture) and Introduction to the use of computers.Engineering
 in general in a very complex subject mainly due to the academic nature
 of the subject, the most difficult part of engineering in physics,
 physics is essentially very high level maths applied to real life
 problems the only way to slove a physics equation is by gathering
 data and using complicated formulas such as v = v0 + at x = x0 + v0t + Â½at2.
</p>
<p>
  I will conclude
  this Bio by thanking you for taking youre time reading this, also
  please check out my CV out it has much more professinal information
  about myself.
