<h1> Welcome to my Bio </h1>

<p> Hello my name is Harry Mosdell this page will contain
  my Bio and casual information about breif myself. I spend my
  leisure time socialising with friends, watching films and
  using social media. I am a passionate fan of Arsenal
  Football Club and I also enjoy watching Formula One. before
  i studied at the University of Northampton i used to study at
  the University of Portsmouth studying computer engineering.
 </p>

 <p>  engineering interested me as I find them
   fascinating subjects to study. Without the technology we have,
   access to the world would not be the same as we know it.
    I also find it interesting that without engineers we couldnt
    create and look after the technology that is available to us.
Im also interested in this course as when its completed I will
 have the relevant qualifications needed to get a job in a
 technology based career. A reason why I want to do so is that
 the technology and engineering industry is always developing and
 changing so there would always be jobs available. I will conclude
 this Bio by thanking you for taking youre time reading this, also
 please check out my CV out it has much more professinal information
 about myself.
     </P
